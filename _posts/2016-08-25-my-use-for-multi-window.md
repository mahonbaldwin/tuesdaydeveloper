Early on when I started using Android I often wished that I could have two apps open at onceâ€”with
Android Nougat I can do that now, but...

Well, even though I've been Nougat on the beta channel for several months, there's just one
thing I really found this feature useful for. And for that one use, I hope they keep it forever!

That's right, I have the Chrome app and Chrome Beta open to the same recipe so I can see the
ingredient list and the cooking instructions side-by-side!
