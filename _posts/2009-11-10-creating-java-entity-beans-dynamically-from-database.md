What to create your entity beans dynamically?

After you've created a new EJB Project in Eclipse and you have a database with tables, sequences, and relationships defined, it is quite easy to create your entity beans dynamically in Eclipse.

<ol>
    <li>Ensure that the JPS Tools are enabled.
        <ol>
            <li>Right click the EJB Project folder and select properties</li>
            <li>On the left hand side of the properties window, select Project Facits</li>
            <li>Check the Java Persistence checkbox</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li>Build the beans from the database.
        <ol>
            <li>Right click the EJB Project folder and select JPA Tools > Generate Entities from Tables...</li>
            <li>Ensure you are connected with the correct server and schema</li>
            <li>Select the entity beans you want in your project.</li>
            <li>Don't for get to tell it which package you want the beans in.</li>
            <li>Click next until it asks you for the sequences for each bean and enter in the appropriate sequence generators.</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li>Click finish and it will build all the entity beans for you.</li>
</ol>

<div>The project will then build the beans for you assuming you have all the appropriate relationships etc.</div><div><br /></div><div>Resources: Kent Jackson (<a href="http://www.byui.edu/">BYU-Idaho</a> Professor)</div><div>(Configuration: Eclipse Galileo for Java EE 6 using JBoss Server on Mac OS X 10.6 connecting to a VMware virtual machine with Windows running an academic licence version of Oracle)</div>
