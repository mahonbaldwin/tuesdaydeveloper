Want to view what information is stored in your datastore in Google App Engine? Go to <a href="http://localhost:8888/_ah/admin">http://localhost:8888/_ah/admin</a> (or <a href="http://localhost:8080/_ah/admin">http://localhost:8080/_ah/admin</a> if you are using that port).

Here is what you'll see:
