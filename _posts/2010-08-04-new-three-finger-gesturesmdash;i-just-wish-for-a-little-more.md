Am I the only one who gets excited when I see a new update is available for my computer?

Today's update: Inertial Scrolling and Three-Finger Drag Gesture.

<a href="/uploads/2010/08/Screen-shot-2010-08-04-at-10.34.16-AM.png"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-426" title="Three-finger drag gesture" src="/uploads/2010/08/Screen-shot-2010-08-04-at-10.34.16-AM-300x260.png" alt="" width="300" height="260" /></a>It's pretty cool, now I can flip through a web page the same way I would on my iPod touch. Just flick with two fingers and let go and it will keep going.

I can also now drag an open window without clicking the trackpad (something I've wished I could do since enabling one-click dragging has led to problems). Of course the only problem with this is that I now have to choose between using the three-finger gesture for navigating web pages or for being able to drag a window—the choice is easy, I'll use it to navigate—window dragging isn't that cool
