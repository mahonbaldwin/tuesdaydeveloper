Is there any competition?

That depends on who you ask.

If I were to buy a new phone (to replace my aging Palm 700p) today, I'd get the <a href="http://sprint.com/evo/">EVO from Sprint</a>, but not without wishing I could get an iPhone too. I'd consider the <a href="http://phones.verizonwireless.com/motorola/droid/">Droid from Verizon</a>, but I'd like to steer clear of Verizon (they may have the broadest signal, but it also seems to be the weakest signal). So why wouldn't I get an iPhone? I'll tell you.

First, I'm terrified of AT&T. I hate dropped calls (they seem to have a lot despite the claim from Cingular who was purchased by AT&T that they had the fewest dropped calls). AT&T doesn't seem to care about this (spoken from the mind of a consumer looking in on the outside).

Second, I'm not fond of the idea for paying data connection overages to AT&T because I don't have an unlimited plan. Besides the fact that their plans are more expensive they also don't offer any unlimited plans any more.

Third, I like choice too much. Yes, Apple has a lot of apps and there is a lot of choice, but those apps are restricted. They don't allow real multitasking (which improves the battery, yes, but I'm still very limited. Also, I <em>love</em> <a href="http://voice.google.com">Google Voice</a>! Why can't I use it on an iPhone?

Last, as a developer, I look at greener pastures where they aren't restrictive, don't cost $99 to join. If I had to choose between the two, I'd go with Google's Android for development.

The iPhone is popular for a reason. A lot of people really like it and is very well implemented in what it does, I jsut wish that Apple would fix the few flaws that it has.

What do you think? Does Apple need to fix these flaws? Are these really flaws at all or am I crazed in the head? Let me know in the comments.

<div class='comment'>Well, I can't comment on the software, but I do have to say that I (and my parents) have had more dropped calls with Sprint than any other company. The best I ever had was Cingular. ;-)  <div class='by'>Cindy on 2010-06-24 23:04:52.0  </div></div>
