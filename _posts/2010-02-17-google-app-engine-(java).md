I've been working on my senior project. I am implementing a tool for <a href="http://prorlty.com/">Professional Reality Services</a> of Pocatello, Idaho. The software will organize their listings and sales, organize employee schedules, and will generate reports for them. I am using Google App Engine because of it's low start-up costs and because it will provide a solution that won't be deleted at the end of the semester (if I used the schools servers they would delete everything). While I chose to use Google App Engine for different reasons, I've found I really like using it. It is very simple to set up. I use the Eclipse with the plugin for my IDE and that has helped me a lot with debugging. Over the next indeterminable number of posts I will describe what I've done and how to use Google App Engine.

Note: Google App Engine supports both Python and Java. I am using the Java syntax.
