I've been blogging here for more than six years and I'm now excited to announce that I'm transitioning my blog from WordPress to Jekyll (because it's cool). You've probably[^1] already noticed the blog layout change which is likely to continue to change in the sort term.

Due to some complications[^2] an achieve with past posts isn't available for now (I'll work on getting them back though).

[^1]: Unless you don't read my blog regularly, which you should start, though I can't really blame you because it's not like there is a lot of new content here on a regular basis.

[^2]: Which may or may not have something to do with why my site has been down for a month. But I'm not pointing fingers. I'm using them to type instead.
