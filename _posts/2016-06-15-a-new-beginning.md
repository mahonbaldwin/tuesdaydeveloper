I've been blogging here for more than six years and I'm now excited to announce that I'm transitioning my blog from WordPress to Jekyll (because it's cool). You've probably[^1] already noticed the blog layout change which is likely to continue to change in the sort term.

You'll also have noticed, my astute reader, that you can't post comments... I'm working on that.

[^1]: Unless you don't read my blog regularly, which you should start, though I can't really blame you because it's not like there is a lot of new content here on a regular basis.
