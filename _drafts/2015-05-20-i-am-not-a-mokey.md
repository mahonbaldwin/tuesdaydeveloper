To start this post off I want to ask you a question:
<p style="text-align: center;">What value does a software engineer bring to a company?</p>
I'll even give you some options to choose from.
<ol>
	<li> Software engineers can speak computer (programming languages, etc).</li>
	<li> Software engineers can speak human <em>and</em> computer (they provide an interface between what the customer wants and how to get it).</li>
	<li>Software engineers can't speak (they like quite).</li>
</ol>
If you answered one, two, or even three, you are wrong. Yes, that's right, this was a trick question (or well... trick answers, the question is non-tricky, but none of the provided answer options were correct).

So what is the correct answer? The most valuable thing that a software engineer can bring to a company is their critical thinking ability.
<h3>Wait, isn't that what execs and management are paid for?</h3>
Regardless of the way you categorize what <em>the boss</em> does, software engineers must be valued first and foremost for their critical thinking skills. No one can raise the right questions who isn't acquainted with the code and must interact with it in order to provide the needed solution. The unfortunate truth is that developers are often treated like trainable monkeys who accept direction and then preform a trick. In reality developers make business decisions every day—do you want a monkey making critical decisions?
<h3>What critical business decisions do developers make?</h3>
Whenever there is a question about requirements that isn't specified in the requirements for a feature a decision is made. A smart engineer will determine which questions need more input from the business or customer, because if she were to ask about every question that comes up then she would spend her entire day asking questions. The smart engineer will be able to gauge, with her critical thinking skills, which questions she can devise her own best solution for and which ones need more clarification. She will also be able to provide valid options to the client in the event that she determines that she does not have enough information to proceed.

A developer does not possess the necessary critical thinking skills will not see any points that need clarification or guess at a solution without proper measurement to determine if it was the right answer or will provide a never-ending stream of questions to the client to the point that the client just gets tired of them being around.

As you can see, there is a fine line between getting it right and getting it wrong. And of course it's true that developers will make the wrong move on occasion, no one is perfect. But with the proper critical thinking skills they will get it right more often that wrong and save you money.
<h3>Do you want to ship that job overseas?</h3>
&nbsp;

I'm not avers to working with developers in other counties to solve the problems that need to be faced. I have, however, witnessed a blatant disregard for the familiarity with the code that an on shore team had and was ultimately replaced with an off shore team.

In truth, people from different cultures and backgrounds can provide different kinds of critical thinking. There may still be challenges, but a skilled developer is a great asset to any team whether he is in the US or in India. Some may say that overseas developers won't be able to

To a large extent communication is a large part of it. If you find that communicating two times a day early in the morning or late at night is adequate, then maybe an off shore team is okay. While language barriers can be overcome they can still prevent challenges. In the end you must communicate your vision to the developer if you have any hope of being able to build your software application successfully.
