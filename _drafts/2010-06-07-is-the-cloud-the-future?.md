What started out as a completely innocent question to my teacher a while ago turned into a discussion about how he felt that the idea of cloud computing wouldn't lift off the ground. "It's been tried, and it's failed."

I probed further and I decided he is right.

Let me begin by saying that the cloud is an awesome idea, but there are flaws. About a month ago I wrote <a href="http://www.tuesdaydeveloper.com/2010/05/replace-computers/">an article outlining the following idea</a>. I've been thinking more about this idea (with additional thought by my teacher) and I have a few more things to say about it.

<strong>Limitations to the Cloud
<span style="font-weight: normal;">There are some who don't feel there are any limitations to the cloud. All of your files will be available to you on any machine that is connected to the internet and so you'll always have access. Ideally, you'll work somewhere with an internet connection, you'll live in a place with an internet connection, and you'll recreate in a world with an internet connection so you'll always have your cloud-connected devices along with all the files you will ever need. While this may be the case some day, that day is not this day.</span></strong>

<strong><span style="font-weight: normal;">But that doesn't mean that we can't use the cloud to our advantage.</span></strong>

<strong><span style="font-weight: normal;"><strong>Limitations to Physical Storage</strong>
The natural opposite to cloud storage is physical storage. I will have all of my files with me where ever I go, so long as I have my laptop with me. I won't need to bother with connections to the "cloud" and you'll always be able to ensure compatibility of your files (since they were created on the machine you're using). Once again, this has it's limitations. What happens when I go somewhere without my laptop and I get an urgent call and need to look up something? Even if I'm near a computer, I won't be able to get to it unless I'm near <em>my</em> computer.</span></strong>

<strong><span style="font-weight: normal;">But that doesn't mean that we can't use physical storage to our advantage.</span></strong>

<strong><span style="font-weight: normal;"><strong>False Dichotomy</strong>
In <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic">logic</a> there is a fallacy called a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_dichotomy">false dichotomy</a>, it seems that almost every tech person has fallen into this line of fallacious thinking. I admit, I was one of them until my enlightening conversation with my professor.</span></strong>

<strong><span style="font-weight: normal;">A false dichotomy is an error in reasoning that we have a limited number of choices; it is either one way or another, but there is no other option. The truth with the cloud computing debate is that we can have our data in the cloud <em>and</em> on our physical media! What a novel idea!</span></strong>

<strong>Advantages</strong>
The advantages are numberless when we consider the possibilities. Besides the obvious advantages that are already being done (like automatic backup) we can do things like reduce the weight of our machines. What do I mean? I touched on that in the <a href="http://www.tuesdaydeveloper.com/2010/05/replace-computers/">article referenced earlier</a>. The simple truth of the matter is this: I don't need all of the files on my machine. Yes, I need them all, but I don't use them all regularly. In fact, most of the files I use are used frequently for a day or a couple weeks, and then I stop using them. I may reference them, but I can get along without them. So, on my device, I can store the file that I regularly need, and the rest I keep stored on the cloud.

There is a right to this strategy. If some computer company made their clients track which files they needed and which they did not, the users would get rather frustrated at all the device maintenance they had to do. That is why the computer should do it for them.
