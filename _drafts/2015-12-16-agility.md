"We're Agile!" Is one of the most annoying phrases you'll hear from software companies. I take umbridge with the phrase because you cannot reliably know what someone means when they claim agility. The <a href="http://www.agilemanifesto.org/" target="_blank">Agile Manifesto</a> came out 15 years this month and has revolutionized the way we develop software. But the world is different than it was in 2001 and I think it's worth a closer look to determine whether "being Agile" (or what that term has come to mean) is still desirable.
