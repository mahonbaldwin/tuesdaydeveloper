Google records a lot of information about how we interact with the Internet. This scares some people in a day in age when a lot of people think that Google <em>is</em> the Internet. I have a lot to say about this.

<span class="quote">The policies and practices for which Google has been criticized include its use of others' intellectual property, concerns that its compilation of data may violate people's privacy, censorship of search results, and the energy consumption of its servers. Much of the criticism of Google pertains to issues that have not yet been addressed by cyber law(<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_Google">Wikipedia</a>, April 23, 2010).</span>

I approve of privacy. At <a href="http://www.byui.edu">BYU-Idaho</a>, the university I attend, the school has what the students have dubbed "stalker net". Basically students information (their name, picture, address, class schedule, email) are available online. The information is not supposed to be used for anything but school related purposes and due to privacy concerns students can opt out.

When it first started I thought to myself, "wouldn't it be cool to have a 'stalker'?" (I was single, what can I say?) Some time during that semester I was set up on a blind date. Before the date I knew her name—the natural thing—look her up on "stalker net". I really just wanted to see her picture. When I was talking with her while on the date, I found out that she did the same thing to me. I didn't really mind at first—I had looked at her picture—but then she started asking weird questions about the classes I was taking. I was so creeped out that I removed everything except my name and picture.

Yes, privacy is very important, but was it the schools fault that I had all of my information there for anyone to read? No, it was my fault, I approved that it be there, I approved the content available, I made it publicly available to any student who wanted to see it. And its the same with Internet privacy.

<span class="quote">Sure, Google is compiling more and more information about us - not just as we surf but also while we’re mobile. And maybe if I were more paranoid, I might be freaked out about that. But I’m not. Google is tapping more information to make my online life better - saving time by giving me information I want when I want it and where I want it" (<a href="http://blogs.zdnet.com/BTL/?p=28178&amp;tag=nl.e539">Diaz</a>).</span>
