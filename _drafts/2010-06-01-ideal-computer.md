I always like reading posts about people's ideal computer/mobile phone/tablet/tech gadget because a lot of the time I have those same wants too. It's excellent to see that we are starting to see real competition in the mobile phone industry. Because of <a href="http://www.android.com/">Android</a>* we see have <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2010/TECH/mobile/05/25/iphone.centric.conference.wired/?hpt=C2">Steve Jobs making promises</a> for excellent thing to come. We are seeing all kinds of wars going on and that means if you don't like Apple's strick rules about apps or <a href="http://www.tuesdaydeveloper.com/2010/05/how-much-do-you-care-about-flash/">flash</a> then you can go with Google and get a more open platform. I appreciate having choices, that ultimately means that things will get better—more choice = more competition = larger drive to be better = more product research = better products.

Of course it seems that when you see lists of the ideal tech gadget the idea never really comes to fruition—desire and demand ≠ ability to produce. :(

But that doesn't stop us from dreaming, right? What would be the ideal computer? I've compiled my ideal list of what a future computer will be. These ideas are what I'd like to see in a computer in the future; I'd love to hear what would be your ideal computer in the comments.

<strong>Form factor: Tablet</strong>
I think that touch tablets are in and I think that desktops/laptops are on their way out. This won't happen overnight and tablets (as they are) cannot yet accomplish this replacement, but one thing I've learned about technology and user interaction is this: customer experience is the most important thing a developer of any kind can worry about. Things must first of all work and work well, be fast enough, and be easy. If a product doesn't do these things or there is a significant tax in some other area (say it costs too much to buy or it takes too many recourses to run) then users won't be happy with their customer experience. Touch screens just so happen to be very intuitive which is a huge plus compared to other input devices. If a customer can know how to use something without instruction, they will be happy.

Of course that assumes that the user interface is intuitive. If you add too many gestures that otherwise are meaningless to a customer then your product becomes more confusing. So an ideal computer will be a tablet with an <a href="http://www.tuesdaydeveloper.com/2010/05/nextdesk-os-desktop-reinvented/">intuitive UI</a>. More on this in a moment.

<strong>Screen size: 17in </strong>
<a href="http://www.tuesdaydeveloper.com/2010/05/replace-computers/">I've said  before that I'd love to have a 24 - 27 inch tablet</a>, this is still true, but I'm making a list of the ideal <em>computer</em>, not the ideal <em>computers</em>. If I had a 27 inch computer, I wouldn't haul it around, but I would be willing to carry a 1 - 3 lb 17 inch tablet around though. Oh, and it can't be too thick either.

<strong>OS: Something full
<span style="font-weight: normal;">I don't care who makes it, but the OS has to be full featured to be a real computer. Let me be clear when I say this, this OS doesn't exist yet. Apple has designed an excellent user experience, but the iPad can't do everything my computer replacement will need to. Android isn't ready yet either, it fails in the same way the iPad does not being full enough for a replacement. I'm excited to see what Chrome OS will bring, but again, I don't see it being full featured enough. A Windows 7 tablet wouldn't be that great because it takes too much power (and so it is either has a really heavy battery or very little wireless time) and it isn't built for touch. The same would be true is Mac OS X came to a tablet. In sort, either everything available now is either not full featured enough or it won't do because it was built with touch in mind; t</span></strong>his is an extremely hard thing to accomplish: a company will have to write a completely new operating system that isn't too resource intensive, is extremely intuitive, and is full featured.

<strong><span style="font-weight: normal;"><strong>Openness: Wide open</strong>
I was originally going to call this point "paradigm", but I didn't want to confuse the point with open source vs. closed source. I prefer open source, but experience has taught me that open sources isn't always as good as the ideal would indicate. What I mean by "openness" is workability; what I can do, see, touch, feel. I may not like flash that much, but if some developer wants to develop in flash and I want his product, then I want him to be able to deliver it to me. I want to get the apps I want without someone else deciding what I can and cannot have. (I'm really not trying to attack Apple here. Morally, I respect their choice to disallow pornographic apps in their app store and I'd do the same thing because I think it is the morally responsible thing to do, but as a customer I have to wonder why I can't get a Google Voice App on my iPhone, though I don't have one).</span></strong>

<strong><span style="font-weight: normal;">All in all, we will be here someday. I sometimes think that capitalism moves too slowly (there's too much litigation) for my ideals. I think we can have this tablet today from a technology standpoint, but I don't expect it for several years because </span></strong>
