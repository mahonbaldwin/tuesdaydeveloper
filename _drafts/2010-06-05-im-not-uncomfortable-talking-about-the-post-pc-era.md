Steve Jobs: The PC is brilliant, we like to talk about the post-PC era, but it's uncomfortable. (<a href="http://www.informationweek.com/news/software/enterpriseapps/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=225300193&amp;cid=RSSfeed_IWK_News">informationweek</a>)

If you have any doubt that I'm excited about the future (aka tablets replacing desktops and laptops) then you need to re-read the following posts:

My question to the people who are "uncomfortable": Why?

When GUI OSs started appearing, people thought they were gimmicks. "Real computer users use DOS." Thank heavens that's not true, but we still had to get used to mice and how to use them. Now we have to get used to mouse-less systems, but this transition will be a lot easier, why? Because touch is intuitive.
