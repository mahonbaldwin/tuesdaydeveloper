## Sprint 1:
Specification says: A plane figure with three straight lines of equal length that meet at the ends forming a total of three interior equiangular angles.

But we get this: A plane figure with three relatively straight lines with one line only slightly longer than the other two forming three interior angles, two of which are equal, the third is slightly different. We are only human, we canâ€™t draw perfectly.

We receive accolades for a sprint well done.

## Sprint 2:
Two stories:
First specification says line needs to be shortened to be equal to the other two, lines still need to meet.
Second specification says that we need to have a fourth side added to our application.

But we get this: A figure that looks like that of the first (with a few lines erased and redrawn leaving some artifacts of old code). On the top there is a fourth side protruding (like a tangent) that does not connect to anything. In the defense of the programmers, this is a perfectly valid response to the specifications that were given.

## Sprint 3:
Specification: connect the end of line three with the end of line four.

Results in what looks like a rhombus, with a few lines erased.

This results in Sprint 4 which asks to make all connecting lines perfectly perpendicular (because what they wanted the whole time was a square), and the process continues.




Consider the possibility that cars and programs a similar:

You have to smash a few cars to make sure the rest are safe. Therefor with programming then we should be expected to throw away code that doesn't work and refactor it to make it better.
