    <p>I’ll be honest. I don’t think that flash has much of a chance. Recently Apple has made it a point to inform the world that <a href="http://www.apple.com/hotnews/thoughts-on-flash/">they aren’t big fans of Flash</a> and they don’t think that their customers care about it either. I was a bit surprised, but I got over it quickly, why? Because I don’t use flash. I don’t watch that many videos (and most are available in non-flash ways anyway), I don’t play flash games, and I <strong>hate </strong>flash based ads!</p>

<p>I know that there are other uses for flash, but I think those uses all have more elegant solutions. Of course Google is now best friends with flash, they’ve <a href="http://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2010/03/google-flash-chrome-browser/">integrated it into Chrome</a> and <a href="http://www.informationweek.com/news/software/web_services/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=224700488">will integrate it into Android 2.2</a>, but why should I care if there are other ways to do everything flash does. I’ll come right out and say that if an employer ever asks me to develop something in flash I’ll say, “Yes, sir.” and get to work, but I can’t imagine that will happen, I just don’t think that flash doesn’t have must application anymore. It’s had its day. If Flash wants to win the game, they need to change the game, I don’t see them doing that. Maybe they will in the future.</p>

<p>There are <a href="http://www.pcworld.com/article/196025/flash_on_iphone.html?tk=rss_news">others who think so too</a>, what are your thoughts?</p>

<div class="archived comments">

<div class="comment">I would agree. Any serious web developer understands the limitations of Flash. With how important SEO is nowadays, there is just no good reason to use it for web design. People hate flash intros. Any interactivity that flash can provide can be created with other technologies like JavaScript or Ajax. Flash is just not that big a deal anymore. 

I also think it's crazy how much crap apple has received over the issue. People keep saying they should have a choice as to what they put on their phone. To that I say you do have a choice - buy a different phone! I guess it's obvious that people really like apple devices, or they wouldn't care so much.

My one complaint is that I would really love to be able to watch hulu on my iPad, but I hear that is on the way. Good riddance flash.  <div class="by">Mark Richardson on 2010-05-17 15:13:54.0  </div></div>
<div class="comment">The only real benefit Flash brings to Android is market share.  They are feeding off the negative publicity surrounding Apple, and they will be rewarded handsomely.  The first thing people say about Apple 4 is that it doesn't have Flash.  The first thing they'll say about Android 2.2 is that it has Flash.

That said, I have to agree with both of you.  Flash shouldn't be used to add functionality to a site, and shouldn't be used for the basics.  It's best suited for advertisements.  And, as you know, Google gets 90% of their revenue from advertisements.  In other words, Google makes more money by backing Flash. Firstly from the sale of handsets, secondly from ad revenue.

As a web developer, I'll be building sites on HTML5, CSS3, Javascript.  I'll leave Flash for the advertisers.  <div class="by">Devin Baldwin on 2010-05-18 23:26:10.0  </div></div>
<div class="comment">You know, I hadn't thought about flash advertisements being a source of revenue, but of course, that's right.  <div class="by">Mahon on 2010-05-19 00:08:17.0  </div></div>
